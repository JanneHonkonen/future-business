## What is VIREL?

**VIREL** is a fully autonomous drone and VTOL relay logistics system designed to replace the inefficiencies of last-mile delivery and inter-hub transport. Instead of ground traffic, it leverages a decentralized network of autonomous electric drones, relay hubs, and cloud-based traffic management.

It is a vision for an *Internet of Packages*—where aerial "data packets" (drones) route through optimized relay nodes to deliver with speed, safety, and minimal human input.

## Highlights

- End-to-end automation: zero human pilots needed
- Modular design: scalable from local to global networks
- Relay architecture: long-distance delivery without massive drones
- Integrated fault-tolerance: no single point of failure
- Multi-client platform model: FedEx, DHL, or even gov services can plug in
- Green-first tech: optimized for emissions and noise
